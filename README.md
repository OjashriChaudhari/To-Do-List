# ✏️ Edit Task Feature
Users can easily edit existing tasks directly from the list. When a task is in edit mode, the text becomes editable, allowing users to update their tasks without deleting and re-adding them. Once edited, the updated task is saved to LocalStorage for persistence.

All task data is stored in the browser’s LocalStorage, ensuring that your to-dos remain saved even if the page is refreshed or the browser is closed.
